Branching strategy for Software Developing Project
A strong branching strategy is essential for effective collaboration and smooth code management in a software development project. Our team, considering our project size, team structure and release activities, proposes the following Git workflow to ensure efficiency, clarity and consistency in our developing process. 

Branching Strategy: 
Branch Types: 
Main branch: (main)
Purpose: This branch represents the stable, production-ready state of the code. 
Rules: Direct comment to main are prohibited. Only merged changes form the develop branch are allowed. 
Development branch (Develop)
	Purpose: Serves as the integration branch for features and fixes. It’s used to aggregate changes before they are considered stable for release.
	Rules:  All features’ branches and bug fix branches are merged into develop.
